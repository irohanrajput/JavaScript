The return statement is specifically designed to end the execution of a function .

-----------------------------------------------------------
function isAllX(string) {
    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++){
        if (string[i].toLowerCase() == "x"){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }

    }

}

module.exports = isAllX;

-----------------------------------------------------------


****code written above is not correct because: ****

______________________________________________________________

when a return statement is encountered inside a function, it immediately stops the execution of the function and returns the specified value to the calling code. The return statement causes the function to exit early, regardless of its location within the function.

In the case of a return statement placed inside a for loop containing an if statement, the following happens:

The for loop starts iterating through the loop body, which includes the if statement and the return statement.

For each iteration of the loop, the if statement checks a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the return statement inside the if block will be executed immediately, and the function will exit with the specified return value.

If the if condition is not met (i.e., evaluates to false), the return statement will not be executed for that iteration, and the loop will continue to the next iteration (if any) or exit if all iterations are complete.

If the for loop completes all iterations without encountering a return statement, the function will continue executing the code that comes after the loop

Here's an example to illustrate this behavior:

-----------------------------------------------------------
function exampleFunction() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
      console.log("Returning from inside the loop.");
      return true;
    }
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
  }

  console.log("This code is after the loop.");
  return false;
}

console.log("Function Result:", exampleFunction());

------------------------------------------------------------



In this example, the loop will run from i = 0 to i = 4. When i is equal to 2, the if condition is met, and the function will immediately exit the loop with return true. Therefore, the output will be:

Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Returning from inside the loop.
Function Result: true



As you can see, the code after the loop (the console.log("This code is after the loop."); line) is not executed because the function exited early with the return statement inside the loop.
